## Description

The cripto/blockchain universe is deep and unknown for people new to it. **duh!**

So to lighten it up a notch, and use myself as a reference tool I build this page wich should contain all the important needs a Blockchain / Dapp programmer can have..  
Regarding types conversion.

## Usage

The cripto universe works with mysterious formats for average humans, like Hashes, Hex and Base 58 Strings if you searching for an all including tool, feel free to use this one.

- Convert Strings into bytes32
- Convert bytes32 into Strings
- Convert Adresses into checksumed Adresses.
- Encode and Decode Hex Strings to Base58
- Create SHA256 hashes from various inputs (including files)
- _to be continued.._
