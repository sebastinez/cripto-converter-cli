## Description

The cripto/blockchain universe is deep and unknown for people new to it. **duh!**

So to lighten it up a notch, and use myself as a reference tool I build this Node CLI App wich should contain all the important needs a Blockchain / Dapp programmer can have..  
Regarding types conversion.

## Installation

```shell
npm install -g web3conv
```

## Usage

The cripto universe works with mysterious formats for average humans, like Hashes, Hex and Base 58 Strings if you searching for an all including tool, feel free to use this one.

- Convert ASCII strings into bytes32.
- Convert bytes32 into ASCII strings.
- Check and convert if needed wallet adresses into checksumed adresses.
- Encode and Decode Hex strings to Base58
- Create cryptographic hashes from Strings and Files
- Create something new
